## [Project 1: Markowitz optimal portfolio creation using the Factor Weighted Lasso Algorithim](https://github.com/HJohnson71/Glasso-Project)
- Leveraged stock market data from yfinance package and a provided database to create Markowitz minimum variance portfolios using the Factor Graphical Lasso (FGL) Algorithm  suggested by [Lee and Seregina](https://academic.oup.com/jfec/article-abstract/22/3/670/7116303?redirectedFrom=fulltext)
- FGL utilizes graphical methods for inverse covariance (precision) matrix estimation
- Created a 6 year rolling window trading strategy with yearly updates to portfolio weights with appropriate transaction fees
- The resulting portfolio outperformed the S&P500 and a balanced (equally weighted) portfolio in returns and volatility
- Portfolio Returns are seen below:

## [Project 2: Creating a Database for an online retailer](https://github.com/HJohnson71/Online-Retailer-Database-Creation)
- SQL database to support business operations of an online retailer
- Features include encrypted payment processing, inventory management, coupon campaigns and supplier details
- Database build with trigger functions to prevent creating negative product inventories and other operational errors
- A small sample of data was entered into the database for sample visualizations using Tableau:

## [Project 3: Support Vector Regression for portfolio optimization](https://github.com/smithjesse3/Trading-Strategy)
- Implemented a trading strategy using Support Vector Regression with RBF kernel method for predicting stock prices and trading every 7days as buy, hold, or sell, based on the generated trading signals.
- Outperformed typical "buy and hold" strategy for a subset of S&P500 stocks by 56% on test data
- Conducted thorough literature review to confirm robustness of the generated portfolio selection model:
