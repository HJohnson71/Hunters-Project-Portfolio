## [Project 1: Markowitz optimal portfolio creation using the Factor Weighted Lasso Algorithim](https://github.com/HJohnson71/Glasso-Project)
- Leveraged stock market data from yfinance package and a provided database to create Markowitz minimum variance portfolios using the Factor Graphical Lasso (FGL) Algorithim suggested by [Lee and Seregina](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00435)
- FGL utilizes graphical methods for inverese covariance (precision) matrix estimation
- Created a 6 year rolling window trading strategy with yearly updates to portfolio weights with appropriate trascation fees
- The resulting portfolio outperformed the S&P500 and a balanced (equally weighted) portfolio in returns and volatility
- Portfolio Returns are seen below:
